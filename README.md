# Amazon-Access

When employees start working in an organization, they first need to obtain the computer access necessary to fulfill their role. This access may allow employees to read/manipulate resources through various applications or web portals. It is assumed that employees fulfilling the functions of a given role will access the same or similar resources. Often, employees figure out the access they need as they encounter roadblocks during their daily work (such as, not being able to log into a reporting portal). A knowledgeable supervisor then takes time to manually grant the access needed to overcome these obstacles. As employees change roles within a company, this access discovery/recovery cycle wastes a huge amount of time and money. There is a considerable amount of data regarding employeesâ€™ roles within an organization and the resources to which they have access. Given the data related to current employees and their provisioned access, models can be built that automatically determine access privileges as employees enter and leave roles within a company. These auto-access models seek to minimize human involvement required to grant or revoke employee access.
